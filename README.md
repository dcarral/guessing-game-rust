# guessing-game-rust

Giving my very first steps to learn _Rust_.

_Guessing Game_ is one of the projects included in [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/):

> Our program will generate a random integer between one and a hundred. It will then prompt us to enter a guess. Upon entering our guess, it will tell us if we're too low or too high. Once we guess correctly, it will congratulate us. Sounds good?

It definitely sounds good to me, so let's go ahead! ;)
